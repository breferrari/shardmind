# ShardMind — Architecture Document

> Package manager for Obsidian vault templates.
> Install, configure, upgrade, and diagnose AI-augmented vaults.

**Version**: 0.1.0 (pre-release)
**Author**: Brenno Ferrari
**Date**: April 7, 2026

## 1. Vision

Markdown vaults are the dominant memory substrate for AI coding agents. obsidian-mind proved the format — 1.3k stars in 3 days, 169 forks performing the same structural surgery to reshape it for their domain. Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern (April 2, 2026) validated the architecture from a completely different starting point.

The problem: there is no standardized way to discover, install, version, compose, or upgrade vault templates. Every project ships as a monolithic git clone with manual setup. Fork authors diverge from upstream with no path back. Users who edit rendered files lose the ability to pull template updates.

ShardMind is the engine that turns vault templates into packages — installable, configurable, upgradeable, and diagnosable.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Shard

A **shard** is a packaged vault template. It includes folder structures, markdown templates, agent operating manuals, hooks, slash commands, subagents, frontmatter schemas, and a values schema. Each shard is identified by `namespace/name@version`.

ShardMind the engine is agent-agnostic — it renders templates and tracks state regardless of which AI reads the output. The shard content determines agent support: a shard can ship `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), `AGENTS.md` (Codex), `GEMINI.md` (Gemini CLI), or any combination. The vault's markdown notes, frontmatter, and folder structure work with any AI. The operational layer (hooks, commands, agent configs) is where agent specificity lives. Claude Code is first-class in obsidian-mind because it has the richest hook system — five lifecycle hooks with external interception points.

### 2.2 Three-State Model

Adapted from Terraform (desired/actual/state) and chezmoi (source/target/destination).

```mermaid
graph LR
    D["🔴 DESIRED STATE\ntemplates/ + values\n\nShard author owns.\nReplaced on update.\nUser never touches."]
    T["🟡 TARGET STATE\nrender templates, values\n\nComputed in memory.\nNever persisted.\nExists only during\ninstall/update."]
    A["🟢 ACTUAL STATE\nfiles on disk\n\nUser owns.\nEdits freely.\nThat's the whole\npoint of Obsidian."]

    D -->|render| T -->|write| A
```

The **state file** (`.shardmind/state.json`) records what was rendered and when, enabling drift detection without restricting the user.

### 2.3 Ownership Model

Every file in the vault has one of three ownership states:

| State | Meaning | Determined by | On update |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **managed** | Rendered from template. User hasn't edited. | `hash(file on disk) == hash(last rendered)` | Silent re-render |
| **modified** | Rendered from template. User HAS edited. | `hash(file on disk) != hash(last rendered)` | Three-way diff in TUI |
| **user** | Created by user or LLM, not from template. | Not in state.json | Never touched |

This is how Terraform detects infrastructure drift — compare state hash against actual. The difference: Terraform overwrites drift. ShardMind respects it.

### 2.4 Values vs Modules

Two distinct mechanisms control a vault's shape:

**Values** control what goes *inside* files. The user's name, organization, vault purpose, and QMD preference are values. They're substituted into templates during rendering. There are 4 values in obsidian-mind.

**Modules** control what files and folders *exist*. The `perf/` directory, the `work/incidents/` folder, the `/review-brief` command, and the `brag-spotter` agent are all parts of the `perf` module. Modules are included or excluded during install. Empty Obsidian folders cost nothing — but a researcher looking at `perf/competencies/` feels the vault isn't for them. Modules give users ownership over the vault's shape.

Values are stored in `shard-values.yaml` (user owns). Module selections are stored in `.shardmind/state.json` (ShardMind owns). Templates are rendered with values. Modules gate which templates are rendered at all.

### 2.5 Locality

ShardMind is vault-local. All state lives in `.shardmind/` inside the vault directory. There is no global state, no `~/.shardmind/`, no central registry of vaults on the machine. Same model as git — each repo is self-contained.

ShardMind resolves the vault root by walking up the directory tree from cwd looking for `.shardmind/`. If found, that's the vault root. If not found, you're not in a shard-managed vault.

Multiple vaults on one machine are independent:

```
~/work-vault/.shardmind/       → obsidian-mind@3.5.0
~/research-vault/.shardmind/   → research-wiki@1.0.0
~/freelance-vault/.shardmind/  → obsidian-mind@3.5.0 (different values + modules)
```

```

Shard authors choose which agents to support. The engine renders all templates regardless — it doesn't know which AI reads the output.

## 4. Manifest: `shard.yaml`

Package identity. Small, stable, rarely changes between versions.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
name: obsidian-mind
namespace: breferrari
version: 3.5.0
description: "Vault template for AI-augmented knowledge work"
persona: "Engineers, researchers, freelancers — anyone using Claude Code as a thinking partner"
license: MIT
homepage: https://github.com/breferrari/obsidian-mind

requires:
  obsidian: ">=1.12.0"
  node: ">=18.0.0"

dependencies:
  - name: obsidian-skills
    namespace: kepano
    version: "^1.0.0"

hooks:
  post-install: hooks/post-install.ts
  post-update: hooks/post-update.ts

# v0.1: dependencies are vendored by the shard author.
# ShardMind validates version compatibility but does not fetch.
```

---

## 5. Schema: `shard-schema.yaml`

Defines three concerns: **values** (template variables), **modules** (optional vault sections), and **frontmatter** (validation rules). Also declares **migrations** between versions.

### 5.1 Values — What Goes Inside Files

Minimal. Only what can't be defaulted.

```yaml
schema_version: 1

values:
  user_name:
    type: string
    required: true
    message: "Your name"
    group: setup

  org_name:
    type: string
    message: "Organization (or 'Independent')"
    default: "Independent"
    group: setup

  vault_purpose:
    type: select
    required: true
    message: "How will you use this vault?"
    options:
      - { value: engineering, label: "Engineering", description: "Projects, incidents, reviews, architecture" }
      - { value: research, label: "Research", description: "Source compilation, wiki, citations" }
      - { value: freelance, label: "Freelance", description: "Clients, projects, invoicing" }
      - { value: general, label: "General", description: "Flexible knowledge work" }
    group: setup

  qmd_enabled:
    type: boolean
    message: "Enable QMD semantic search?"
    default: true
    hint: "Requires: npm install -g @tobilu/qmd"
    group: setup

groups:
  - id: setup
    label: "⚡ Quick Setup"
```

Four values. One group. One TUI screen. Done in 30 seconds.

### 5.2 Modules — What Files Exist

Modules are vault sections that can be included or excluded during install. Each declares its paths, CLAUDE.md partials, commands, agents, and bases.

```yaml
modules:
  brain:
    label: "Goals, memories, patterns, decisions"
    paths: ["brain/"]
    removable: false

  work:
    label: "Active projects, archive"
    paths: ["work/active/", "work/archive/", "work/Index.md"]
    removable: false

  reference:
    label: "Codebase knowledge, architecture"
    paths: ["reference/"]
    removable: false

  thinking:
    label: "Scratchpad"
    paths: ["thinking/"]
    removable: false

  org:
    label: "People, teams"
    paths: ["org/"]
    partials: ["claude/_org.md.njk"]
    commands: ["slack-scan"]
    removable: true

  perf:
    label: "Brag doc, competencies, reviews"
    paths: ["perf/"]
    partials: ["claude/_perf.md.njk"]
    commands: ["review-brief", "self-review", "review-peer", "peer-scan"]
    agents: ["brag-spotter", "review-prep", "review-fact-checker"]
    bases: ["competency-map", "review-evidence"]
    removable: true

  incidents:
    label: "Incident tracking"
    paths: ["work/incidents/"]
    partials: ["claude/_incidents.md.njk"]
    commands: ["incident-capture"]
    agents: ["slack-archaeologist"]
    bases: ["incidents"]
    removable: true

  1on1s:
    label: "1:1 meeting notes"
    paths: ["work/1-1/"]
    partials: ["claude/_1on1s.md.njk"]
    commands: ["capture-1on1"]
    bases: ["1-1-history"]
    removable: true
```

`removable: false` means core — always included. `removable: true` means the user can deselect it during install. All modules default to included. The install flow shows a multiselect review step after values — most users press Enter.

### 5.3 Signals — How the Vault Thinks

Classification signals define what the `classify.ts` hook looks for and where it routes content. Core signals always apply. Module-gated signals only apply if their module is included. The hook reads these at runtime — no hardcoded signal lists.

```yaml
signals:
  - id: DECISION
    description: "A choice was made with reasoning"
    routes_to: "work/active/ or brain/Key Decisions.md"
    core: true

  - id: WIN
    description: "Achievement, praise, or milestone"
    routes_to: "perf/Brag Doc.md"
    core: true

  - id: PATTERN
    description: "Recurring behavior worth documenting"
    routes_to: "brain/Patterns.md"
    core: true

  - id: ARCHITECTURE
    description: "System design, technical structure"
    routes_to: "reference/ or projects/<name>/decisions/"
    core: true

  - id: PERSON
    description: "Information about someone"
    routes_to: "org/people/"
    module: org

  - id: INCIDENT
    description: "Something broke, needs investigation"
    routes_to: "work/incidents/"
    module: incidents

  - id: PRODUCT
    description: "Feature ideas, roadmap, user feedback"
    routes_to: "projects/<relevant>/notes/"
    core: true

  - id: CONTENT
    description: "Draft idea, publishing plan, platform strategy"
    routes_to: "content/drafts/"
    core: true

  - id: STRATEGY
    description: "Growth plan, positioning, competitive analysis"
    routes_to: "strategy/"
    core: true
```

Each module's CLAUDE.md partial documents its own signals. The `_core.md.njk` partial documents universal signals. `classify.ts` reads the schema at runtime via `shardmind/runtime` — fully data-driven.

> [!note] Gap found by validating against the Vigil Mind Reshape
> The reshape changed classify.py from 7 to 9 signals. Without signals in the schema, every domain (researcher, freelancer, student) would need to hand-edit the classifier. With signals in the schema, `/dump` routes correctly for every domain out of the box.

### 5.4 Frontmatter Rules

Validation rules per note type. Doctor and PostToolUse hook both validate against these. Supports arbitrary note type keys with `path_match` for shard-specific types.

```yaml
frontmatter:
  global: [date, description, tags]
  work-note:
    required: [date, status, project]
  incident:
    required: [date, status, quarter, ticket, severity, role]
    path_match: "work/incidents/*.md"
  person:
    required: [date, title]
    path_match: "org/people/*.md"
  1-1:
    required: [date, quarter]
    path_match: "work/1-1/*.md"
  # Shard authors add custom note types:
  project-readme:
    required: [date, status, description]
    path_match: "work/projects/*/README.md"
  decision:
    required: [date, status, project]
    path_match: "work/projects/*/decisions/*.md"
```

`path_match` tells the validation hook how to identify which note type a file is. Without it, type is inferred from parent folder. With it, shard authors can define domain-specific note types (e.g., `project-readme` for a Rails dev who needs `rails_version` in frontmatter).

> [!note] Validated by two independent reshapes
> eliluvish added `project`, `github_issue`, `rails_version`, `ruby_version` as custom frontmatter. The Vigil Mind reshape added `project`, `platform`, `audience`. Both needed note types beyond the predefined set. `path_match` enables this without changing the engine.

### 5.4 Migrations

Declared changes between versions for upgrading `shard-values.yaml`:

```yaml
migrations:
  - from_version: "3.4.0"
    changes:
      - { type: rename, old: review_frequency, new: review_cycle }
      - { type: added, key: vault_purpose, default: "engineering" }
      - { type: removed, key: legacy_brag_format }
```

---

## 6. Values: `shard-values.yaml`

The user's file. Created on first install. ShardMind **never overwrites** it after creation.

```yaml
# shard-values.yaml — YOUR configuration.
# Edit freely. Run 'shardmind --verbose' to validate.

user_name: "Brenno Ferrari"
org_name: "Acme Corp"
vault_purpose: engineering
qmd_enabled: true
```

---

## 7. Template Engine

### 7.1 Nunjucks

All `.njk` files use Nunjucks (Mozilla's Jinja2 port for JavaScript). `{{ }}` syntax is the industry standard. Configuration: `autoescape: false`.

### 7.2 Frontmatter-Aware Rendering

The renderer splits frontmatter from body, renders each separately, parses frontmatter as YAML for safety (handles escaping of special characters), re-stringifies, and recombines.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[".njk template<br/>---<br/>type: ﹛﹛ note_type ﹜﹜<br/>tags: [﹛﹛ org_slug ﹜﹜]<br/>---<br/># ﹛﹛ title ﹜﹜<br/>﹛% if qmd_enabled %﹜...﹛% endif %﹜"] --> B

    B["Split at --- markers"] --> C
    B --> D

    C["Frontmatter string<br/>→ Nunjucks render<br/>→ YAML.parse (validate)<br/>→ YAML.stringify (escape)"] --> E["Safe frontmatter string"]

    D["Body string<br/>→ Nunjucks render"] --> F["Rendered body"]

    E --> G["Recombine:<br/>--- + safeFM + --- + body"]
    F --> G

    style A fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#f5a623,color:#fff
    style G fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#0f9d58,color:#fff
```

### 7.3 CLAUDE.md Partials

CLAUDE.md is too monolithic to templatize as one file. Instead, it's assembled from per-module partials. The root template includes partials for included modules only:

```markdown
{% include "claude/_core.md.njk" %}

{% for module in included_modules %}
{% include "claude/_" + module + ".md.njk" ignore missing %}
{% endfor %}
```

Each partial is independently maintained. On upgrade, if only `_incidents.md.njk` changes, only users who included the incidents module see the diff.

### 7.4 Dynamic File Generation

Templates prefixed with `_each` iterate over list values. For each item in the corresponding list, renders a separate file named from `item.slug`. Files track individually in state.json.

### 7.5 Module-Gated Rendering

The renderer checks module inclusion before rendering any template. If a template's path falls within an excluded module's paths, it's skipped entirely. No conditional blocks needed in the templates themselves — the file simply doesn't exist.

---

## 8. State File: `.shardmind/state.json`

The bridge between desired and actual state.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "shard": "breferrari/obsidian-mind",
  "source": "github:breferrari/obsidian-mind",
  "version": "3.5.0",
  "installed_at": "2026-04-07T14:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-07T14:30:00Z",
  "values_hash": "sha256:aaa...",
  "modules": {
    "brain": "included",
    "work": "included",
    "reference": "included",
    "thinking": "included",
    "org": "included",
    "perf": "excluded",
    "incidents": "included",
    "1on1s": "excluded"
  },
  "files": {
    "CLAUDE.md": {
      "template": "templates/CLAUDE.md.njk",
      "rendered_hash": "sha256:abc...",
      "ownership": "managed"
    },
    "brain/North Star.md": {
      "template": "templates/brain/North Star.md.njk",
      "rendered_hash": "sha256:def...",
      "ownership": "managed"
    }
  }
}
```

Key fields:
- `source` — where to fetch updates from. Read by `shardmind update`. User never re-specifies.
- `modules` — which modules are included/excluded. Persists across updates. User can change during update.
- `files` — per-file hash tracking for drift detection.

### 8.1 Cached Templates

`.shardmind/templates/` stores the templates that produced the current rendered files. This is the **base** in three-way merge during update.

---

## 9. Runtime Hooks (TypeScript)

Hooks execute during Claude Code sessions. They import `shardmind/runtime` to read values and module state.

```
.claude/scripts/
├── session_start.ts        # SessionStart: inject context based on purpose + modules
├── classify.ts             # UserPromptSubmit: classify content, inject routing hints
├── validate_note.ts        # PostToolUse: validate frontmatter per note type
├── backup_transcript.ts    # PreCompact: save session transcript
├── session_end.ts          # Stop: checklist, update indexes
└── charcount.sh            # Tiny shell utility (stays as shell)
```

Hooks read `shard-values.yaml` and `.shardmind/state.json` at runtime to adapt behavior:

```typescript
import { loadValues, loadState } from 'shardmind/runtime';

const values = await loadValues();
const state = await loadState();

// Always
await injectNorthStar();
await injectActiveProjects();

// Purpose-aware
if (values.vault_purpose === 'research') await injectWikiIndex();
if (values.vault_purpose === 'engineering') await injectRecentGitChanges();

// Module-aware
if (state?.modules.perf === 'included') await injectBragSummary();
if (state?.modules['1on1s'] === 'included') await injectUpcoming1on1s();
```

Hooks are always **managed** (replaced on update). Users customize behavior through values and module selection, not by editing scripts.

### 9.3 Hook Contract

Post-install and post-update hooks receive a typed context and run as best-effort (non-fatal):

```typescript
interface HookContext {
  vaultRoot: string;
  values: Record<string, unknown>;
  modules: Record<string, 'included' | 'excluded'>;
  shard: { name: string; version: string };
  previousVersion?: string;      // Only for post-update
}

// Hook file exports a default async function:
export default async function(ctx: HookContext): Promise<void>;
```

**Hooks CAN**: read/write files in vaultRoot, run shell commands (`git init`, `qmd setup`), log to stdout (shown in TUI).

**Hooks CANNOT**: modify `.shardmind/` (ShardMind owns it), modify `shard-values.yaml` (user owns it), return values that affect install/update flow.

**If a hook throws**: ShardMind logs the error, shows a warning ("post-install hook failed: {message}"), does NOT rollback. Non-fatal. Same pattern as Helm post-install hooks.

### 9.4 Git Tracking

`.shardmind/` contains both trackable state and derivable cache:

| File | Track in git? | Reason |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `.shardmind/state.json` | **Yes** | Collaborators see which shard and version |
| `.shardmind/shard.yaml` | **Yes** | Offline reference |
| `.shardmind/shard-schema.yaml` | **Yes** | Offline reference |
| `.shardmind/templates/` | **No** | Derivable, re-downloaded on update |

The shard's `.gitignore.njk` template includes:

```
# ShardMind cache (re-downloaded on update)
.shardmind/templates/
```

---

## 10. Commands

### 10.1 Command Surface

Three commands. Two that write. One that reads.

| Command | What | Writes? |
|---------|------|---------|
| `shardmind` | Status + health | No |
| `shardmind install <namespace/name>` | Install a shard | Yes |
| `shardmind update` | Upgrade to latest version | Yes |
| `shardmind --verbose` | Detailed diagnostics | No |

No `list` (vault-local, one shard per vault, nothing to list). No `doctor` (baked into status). No `init` (v1 shards are authored by hand).

### 10.2 `shardmind` — Status

The root command. Shows vault health at a glance. Runs hash comparisons and file existence checks. No network call by default (update check cached for 24 hours).

**Installed, healthy:**

```
◆ shardmind

  breferrari/obsidian-mind v3.5.0
  Installed 3 weeks ago · 47 managed files · 0 modified

  ✓ Up to date
```

**Installed, needs attention:**

```
◆ shardmind

  breferrari/obsidian-mind v3.5.0
  Installed 3 weeks ago · 47 managed files · 4 modified

  ⬆  v4.0.0 available — run 'shardmind update'
  ⚠  QMD not installed (qmd_enabled is true)
  ⚠  3 notes missing required frontmatter
```

**Not in a vault:**

```
◆ shardmind

  Not in a shard-managed vault.

  Get started:
    shardmind install breferrari/obsidian-mind
```

### 10.3 `shardmind --verbose` — Detailed Diagnostics

Full diagnostic output. Replaces the old `doctor` command concept.

```
◆ shardmind --verbose

  breferrari/obsidian-mind v3.5.0

  Values:
    ✓ 4/4 valid

  Modules:
    ✓ brain, work, reference, thinking, org, incidents (included)
    · perf, 1on1s (excluded)

  Files:
    ✓ 43 managed (unchanged)
    ⚠  4 modified by you:
       CLAUDE.md — you added a custom section
       brain/North Star.md — filled in your goals
       brain/Patterns.md — added 3 patterns
       work/Index.md — added project links
    · 127 user-created (not tracked)

  Frontmatter:
    ✓ 44/47 notes valid
    ⚠  work/active/Auth Refactor.md — missing 'quarter'
    ⚠  work/incidents/Redis Outage.md — missing 'severity'
    ⚠  org/people/Sarah Chen.md — missing 'title'

  Environment:
    ✓ Obsidian CLI available
    ✓ Node.js v22.1.0
    ⚠  QMD not installed (qmd_enabled is true)
    ⬆  v4.0.0 available (run 'shardmind update')
```

**v0.1 deviations from the example above**:

- **Per-modified-file flavor text** (`"you added a custom section"`, `"filled in your goals"`) is aspirational; natural-language summaries of user edits would require semantic diff (LLM-class understanding) we deliberately keep out of the engine. **Numeric `+N/−M` change counts are shipped** in verbose mode: for each modified file, `core/status.ts` renders the cached template against current values and runs a 2-way line diff, bounded by `MODIFIED_DIFF_CONCURRENCY = 8` to keep the common-case status run sub-second on large vaults. CRLF and leading-BOM normalization apply, and a pure-whitespace change renders as `(whitespace-only)` rather than a confusing `+0/−0`.
- **Shard-specific environment rows** like `"QMD not installed"` require a shard to contribute diagnostics. v0.1 has no `status` hook type (hooks are post-install and post-update only), so the Environment section ships with Node.js version and a PATH-lookup answer for the Obsidian CLI. Shard-contributed diagnostics are a future enhancement.
- **Update-available line** is cache-backed (24h TTL; see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md §4.15`). When the cache answer is stale — network offline but a previous check exists — the line suffixes `(cached)` so the user can tell.

### 10.4 `shardmind install <shard>` — Install Flow

```
shardmind install breferrari/obsidian-mind

  ⚡ Quick Setup

  Your name: █
```

After 4 value prompts, a module review step:

```
  Your vault will include:

  ✓ brain/          Goals, memories, patterns, decisions
  ✓ work/           Active projects, archive
  ✓ reference/      Codebase knowledge, architecture
  ✓ thinking/       Scratchpad

Defaults: all included. User deselects what doesn't fit. Most press Enter.

After confirm: render → write → state.json → post-install hook → summary.

### 10.5 `shardmind update` — Upgrade Flow

```
shardmind update

  breferrari/obsidian-mind v3.5.0 → v4.0.0

  Fetching v4.0.0…
```

If new values were added to the schema: prompt only for those. If schema migrations exist: apply automatically, surface warnings in the final summary. If new optional modules appeared in the new shard: offer to include them (default on). If any modified-by-user files are no longer produced by the new shard: ask whether to keep your version (untracked) or delete.

Then the diff review:

```
  43 files unchanged (silent re-render)
   2 files auto-merged
   1 file needs your review:

  Conflict in CLAUDE.md (1 of 1)
    lines 47–52
    before line
    <<<<<<< yours
    ## Custom Section
    My custom workflow for auth reviews
    =======
    ## Auth Review Workflow
    Updated process for Q2 2026
    >>>>>>> shard update
    after line

    150 unchanged · 8 auto-merged · 1 region conflicted

  [Accept new] [Keep mine] [Skip] (Open in editor · v0.2)
```

After resolution: the executor snapshots every path it will touch to `.shardmind/backups/update-<timestamp>/`, applies writes and deletes in two passes (writes first so a delete can't clobber a new file at the same path), re-caches the manifest + schema + templates, writes new `state.json`, then runs the non-fatal post-update hook. Any failure between snapshot and state-write walks the snapshot back and leaves the vault indistinguishable from pre-update.

Flags:
- `--yes` — skip every prompt; opt into every new optional module and auto-keep every conflict (useful for unattended CI upgrades).
- `--verbose` — show per-file action history during the write phase.
- `--dry-run` — run the full pipeline (fetch, migrate, plan, merge) without touching the vault; the summary reports what *would* happen.

Implementation modules: `source/core/migrator.ts` (IMPLEMENTATION §4.10), `source/core/update-planner.ts` (§4.11), `source/core/update-executor.ts` (§4.12). Orchestration lives in `source/commands/hooks/use-update-machine.ts`. The full phase diagram is in IMPLEMENTATION §3.

### 10.6 Install Location

Always the current directory. Same as `git init`. The convention: `cd` into your vault folder and run the command.

```bash
mkdir my-vault && cd my-vault
shardmind install breferrari/obsidian-mind
```

If the directory isn't empty, ShardMind warns and asks to confirm. No `--dir` flag in v1.

### 10.7 Update Fetching

`shardmind update` reads the `source` field from `.shardmind/state.json`, checks GitHub for the latest tag, compares semver. If newer, downloads tarball. No arguments needed — the state file knows where the shard came from.

For pinning: `shardmind update --version 3.6.0`.

## 11. Technology Stack

### 11.1 Framework Layer

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| **pastel** | CLI framework — file-system routing, zod arg parsing, Commander under the hood |
| **ink** | React renderer for terminal (Yoga flexbox) |
| **@inkjs/ui** | Pre-built components: Select, TextInput, ConfirmInput, Spinner, ProgressBar, Badge, StatusMessage |
| **react** | Required peer dependency |

### 11.2 Core Layer

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| **nunjucks** | Template engine (`{{ }}` syntax, `{% if %}`, `{% include %}`) |
| **yaml** | YAML parsing (eemeli/yaml — modern, TypeScript-typed) |
| **tar** | Tarball download + extraction (isaacs/node-tar) |
| **semver** | Version parsing, range checking, comparison |
| **zod** | Schema validation (shared with Pastel for arg parsing) |
| **diff** | Unified diff generation for update previews |
| **node-diff3** | Three-way merge algorithm (Khanna-Myers diff3) |

### 11.3 Dev Layer

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| **typescript** | Language |
| **@sindresorhus/tsconfig** | Pastel's recommended TS config |
| **vitest** | Test runner |

### 11.4 Dependency Risk: `@inkjs/ui`

**Status (as of April 2026):** frozen upstream. Last release `2.0.0` on 2024-05-22. Last maintainer commit on 2024-05-22. Last maintainer comment on issues: June 2023. Meanwhile the same maintainer actively ships `ink` itself (7.0.0 / 7.0.1 in April 2026). Not archived, but behaviorally abandoned.

**Why we still depend on it.** It covers the full wizard surface in one package: `TextInput`, `Select`, `MultiSelect`, `ConfirmInput`, `Spinner`, `ProgressBar`, `StatusMessage`, `Alert`, `Badge`. No maintained alternative at equivalent breadth exists. The standalone `ink-*` packages (`ink-text-input`, `ink-select-input`) are similarly frozen, and `ink-multi-select` / `ink-progress-bar` are years-dead. `OpenTUI` is a different renderer entirely, not a drop-in swap.

**Hedge: `source/components/ui.ts` shim.** Every TUI file imports components from `./ui.js` rather than `@inkjs/ui` directly. The shim is a one-file re-export. To swap the backend (vendor a component, fork the library, migrate wholesale), only `ui.ts` changes. Callsites are untouched.

**Swap triggers** — any one of:
1. A second real bug we need to patch locally (the first was the `ExistingInstallGate` `onChange` quirk — see upstream issue [vadimdemedes/ink-ui#26](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-ui/issues/26) and PR [#27](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-ui/pull/27)).
2. Ink 7 or later breaks compatibility and nobody upstream fixes it.
3. We need a component `@inkjs/ui` doesn't provide.

**When a trigger fires, vendor the 2–3 components that bit us into `source/components/vendor/*` and route `ui.ts` through the vendored copies. Don't fork the whole package unless the count grows past ~5 components.**

**Revisit cadence.** Re-evaluate at v0.2 scope freeze. Do not pre-emptively migrate.

## 14. Karpathy Research Wiki as a Shard

Completely different structure. Same engine.

```
research-vault/
├── .shardmind/
├── shard-values.yaml                  # research_topic, wiki_style, etc.
│
├── CLAUDE.md                          # Research-specific operating manual
├── Home.md
│
├── raw/                               # User drops source docs here
│   └── README.md
├── wiki/                              # LLM compiles articles here

```

No perf/. No org/. No incidents/. Different commands, agents, CLAUDE.md. Same ShardMind engine.

## 15. SOUL — Guided File Creation (v0.2)

SOUL.md is a new pattern: **guided creation**. The template provides structure (section headers, instructions). The user provides content (biography, personality, anti-patterns). A rendered-but-empty template is worthless — the value comes entirely from the user's input.

In the ownership model, SOUL is a **modified** file from the moment the user fills in the first line. The three-way merge handles it cleanly — if v4.0 adds new SOUL sections, the merge engine appends them while preserving the user's existing 300+ lines. This is merge scenario 09 (user added content, template added different content, auto-merge succeeds).

**For v0.1**: ship as empty template with section headers and instructions (Option B).

**For v0.2**: add `guided_files` to `shard-schema.yaml` — a third install phase after values and module review:

```yaml
guided_files:
  - path: brain/SOUL.md
    template: templates/brain/SOUL.md.njk
    label: "🧠 SOUL — teach Claude who you are"
    optional: true
    prompts:
      - key: soul_name
        type: string
        message: "Your name"
      - key: communication_style
        type: select
        message: "Communication style"
        options:
          - { value: direct, label: "Direct — skip the fluff" }
          - { value: collaborative, label: "Collaborative — think with me" }
          - { value: structured, label: "Structured — options and tradeoffs" }
      - key: anti_patterns
        type: list
        message: "What should Claude NEVER do?"
        item_type: string
```

> [!important] The demo that sells ShardMind
> SOUL is the most emotionally compelling feature. The terminal recording of `shardmind update` preserving a 386-line identity document through a template upgrade — new sections appended, existing content untouched — is worth more than any technical diagram.

---

## 16. Structural Variants (v0.2 — Flagged)

> [!warning] Deferred — flag for future
> The Vigil Mind Reshape revealed that different purposes need different folder structures (not just different modules). Engineers use `work/active/`, creators use `projects/<name>/`, researchers use `raw/` + `wiki/`. This isn't adding/removing a module — it's changing how a core module is organized.
>
> For v0.1: different purposes are different shards. obsidian-mind is the engineering shard. Creator-builder is a separate shard sharing core partials. Research wiki is its own shard.
>
> For v0.2: modules gain a `structure` field with purpose-driven variants. Design doc: the reshape decision record IS the spec for this feature.

---

## 17. Registry (Phase 0)

Single GitHub repository: `shardmind/registry`. One JSON file.

```json
{
  "shards": {
    "breferrari/obsidian-mind": {
      "source": "github:breferrari/obsidian-mind",
      "description": "Vault for AI-augmented knowledge work",
      "latest": "3.5.0"
    },
    "breferrari/research-wiki": {
      "source": "github:breferrari/research-wiki-shard",
      "description": "LLM-compiled research wiki (Karpathy pattern)",
      "latest": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Versions resolved from git tags. No database. No server. Complexity later if needed.

---

## 18. `shardmind/runtime` Module

Thin, separately exported entry point from the ShardMind npm package. Hook scripts import it. Zero dependency on Ink, Pastel, React, or any CLI-specific code.

### 16.1 Package Exports

```json
{
  "name": "shardmind",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/cli.js",
    "./runtime": "./dist/runtime/index.js"
  }
}
```

### 16.2 API Surface

```typescript
// source/runtime/index.ts

/** Load and parse shard-values.yaml from vault root. */
export async function loadValues(): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>;

/** Load and parse shard-schema.yaml from .shardmind/ cache. */
export async function loadSchema(): Promise<ShardSchema>;

/** Validate values against schema. Returns { valid, errors }. */
export function validateValues(values: Record<string, unknown>, schema: ShardSchema): ValidationResult;

/** Validate a note's frontmatter against schema rules. */
export async function validateFrontmatter(filePath: string, content: string): Promise<FrontmatterValidationResult>;

/** Load state file. Returns null if not installed. */
export async function loadState(): Promise<ShardState | null>;

/** Get included modules from state. */
export async function getIncludedModules(): Promise<string[]>;

/** Resolve vault root by walking up from cwd looking for .shardmind/. */
export function resolveVaultRoot(): string;
```

### 16.3 Types

```typescript
export interface ShardState {
  shard: string;
  source: string;
  version: string;
  installed_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  values_hash: string;
  modules: Record<string, 'included' | 'excluded'>;
  files: Record<string, FileState>;
}

export interface FileState {
  template: string | null;
  rendered_hash: string;
  ownership: 'managed' | 'modified' | 'user';
  iterator_key?: string;
}

export interface ShardSchema {
  schema_version: number;
  values: Record<string, ValueDefinition>;
  groups: GroupDefinition[];
  modules: Record<string, ModuleDefinition>;
  frontmatter: Record<string, FrontmatterRule>;
  migrations: Migration[];
}

export interface ModuleDefinition {
  label: string;
  paths: string[];
  partials?: string[];
  commands?: string[];
  agents?: string[];
  bases?: string[];
  removable: boolean;
}

export interface ValueDefinition {
  type: 'string' | 'boolean' | 'number' | 'select' | 'multiselect' | 'list';
  required?: boolean;
  message: string;
  default?: unknown;
  options?: Array<{ value: string; label: string; description?: string }>;
  min?: number;
  max?: number;
  group: string;
  hint?: string;
  placeholder?: string;
}

export interface GroupDefinition {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  description?: string;
}

export interface FrontmatterRule {
  required?: string[];
}

export type Migration = {
  from_version: string;
  changes: MigrationChange[];
};

export type MigrationChange =
  | { type: 'rename'; old: string; new: string }
  | { type: 'added'; key: string; default: unknown }
  | { type: 'removed'; key: string }
  | { type: 'type_changed'; key: string; from: string; to: string; transform: string };
```

### 16.4 Dependency Isolation

Runtime imports only: `yaml`, `zod`, `node:fs/promises`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`. Total footprint ~30KB. No React. No Ink. No network.

### 16.5 Build Isolation

```typescript
// tsup.config.ts
export default {
  entry: {
    cli: 'source/cli.ts',
    'runtime/index': 'source/runtime/index.ts',
  },
  format: ['esm'],
  dts: true,
  splitting: true,
};
```

## 19. Testing Strategy

### 17.1 Testing Tiers

| Tier | What | Framework | Location |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Unit** | Pure functions: renderer, schema, drift, migrator, modules | vitest | `tests/unit/` |
| **Integration** | Multi-module flows: install pipeline, update pipeline | vitest | `tests/integration/` |
| **Fixture-based** | Three-way merge scenarios with real files | vitest + fixture dirs | `tests/fixtures/` |
| **E2E** | Full CLI invocation against temp vault | vitest + execa | `tests/e2e/` |

### 17.2 Fixture Directory Structure

```
tests/fixtures/
├── merge/                              # 16 three-way merge scenarios

### 17.3 The 20 Merge Scenarios

Seventeen spec scenarios plus three edge cases. Each is a directory under
`tests/fixtures/merge/` with `scenario.yaml` + templates + values + actual
file + expected output. The fixture runner dispatches by scenario flag:
standard scenarios go through `computeMergeAction`; orchestration-level
scenarios (new file / removed / volatile / module change) dispatch to
rendering or drift classification directly.

| # | Scenario | Ownership | Template? | Values? | User edited? | Expected |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 01 | No change | managed | no | no | no | Skip |
| 02 | Template changed | managed | yes | no | no | Silent overwrite |
| 03 | Values changed | managed | no | yes | no | Silent re-render |
| 04 | Both changed | managed | yes | yes | no | Silent re-render |
| 05 | User edited, nothing upstream | modified | no | no | yes | Skip. Preserve user's. |
| 06 | Template changed, user edited different section | modified | yes | no | yes | Auto-merge |
| 07 | Template changed, user edited SAME section | modified | yes | no | yes | Conflict → TUI |
| 08 | User deleted section | modified | yes | no | deletion | Auto-merge (honor deletion, apply non-conflicting template edit) |
| 09 | User added below template | modified | yes | no | addition | Auto-merge, preserve additions |
| 10 | New file from template | — | — | — | — | Render, add to state |
| 11 | File removed from template | managed | — | — | no | Ask: delete or keep? |
| 12 | Frontmatter only change | managed | yes (fm) | no | no | Re-render (managed overwrite) |
| 13 | Module newly included on update | — | — | — | — | Render as fresh install for that module |
| 14 | Module excluded on update | included | — | — | — | Ask: delete files or keep as user-owned? |
| 15 | _each item added | managed | no | yes | no | Render new file |
| 16 | CLAUDE.md partial updated | managed | yes | no | no | Re-render full CLAUDE.md |
| 17 | Volatile file, template changed | volatile | yes | no | yes | Skip (never re-render volatile) |
| 18 | Empty file → shard adds content | managed | yes | no | no | Overwrite |
| 19 | UTF-8 non-ASCII round-trip | modified | yes | no | yes | Auto-merge, bytes preserved |
| 20 | Frontmatter edited + body edited (modified) | modified | yes | no | yes | Auto-merge (user tag + shard body change) |

### 17.4 Three-Way Merge Implementation

Uses `node-diff3`'s `diff3MergeRegions` (Khanna–Myers algorithm) — **not**
the flat `diff3Merge`. The regions variant exposes `buffer: 'a' | 'o' | 'b'`
on stable regions and separate `aContent / oContent / bContent` on unstable
ones, which is the only way to distinguish stable-unchanged lines from
stable-auto-merged lines and produce accurate merge stats.

```typescript
import { diff3MergeRegions } from 'node-diff3';

export function threeWayMerge(base, theirs, ours): ThreeWayMergeResult {
  const regions = diff3MergeRegions(
    theirs.split(/\r?\n/),  // a — user on disk
    base.split(/\r?\n/),    // o — old rendered (cached)
    ours.split(/\r?\n/),    // b — new rendered
  );

  for (const r of regions) {
    if (r.stable) {
      emit(r.bufferContent);
      if (r.buffer === 'o') stats.linesUnchanged   += r.bufferContent.length;
      else                  stats.linesAutoMerged  += r.bufferContent.length;
      continue;
    }
    // Unstable: classify as auto-merge or true conflict.
    if (arraysEqual(r.aContent, r.oContent))       emit(r.bContent);  // ours
    else if (arraysEqual(r.bContent, r.oContent))  emit(r.aContent);  // theirs
    else if (arraysEqual(r.aContent, r.bContent))  emit(r.aContent);  // false conflict
    else                                           emitConflictMarkers(...);
  }
}
```

The `/\r?\n/` split tolerates CRLF on Windows-saved user files while base and
ours are renderer output (always LF). Merged output is always LF — callers
convert at the write boundary if they need platform-native line endings.

### 17.5 Edge Cases

| Edge case | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| **Frontmatter merge** | Render the whole file; renderer parses frontmatter and emits normalized YAML (parse → stringify via `yaml`). diff3 then line-merges the whole document. User tag additions and shard field additions merge cleanly because disjoint YAML keys become non-adjacent lines. Fixture 20 proves this. |
| **Empty file** | Render pipeline produces an empty string; `sha256(base) === sha256(ours)` short-circuits the no-change path. Fixture 18 tests the variant where base is empty but ours has content → overwrite. |
| **Hash-identical after re-render** | Short-circuit via `sha256(base) === sha256(ours)`. No diff3 pass. Covered by scenarios 01, 05. |
| **CRLF user file** | `split(/\r?\n/)` normalizes on the way in; merged output is LF. Covered by `tests/unit/differ-line-endings.test.ts`. |
| **UTF-8 non-ASCII** | diff3 is byte/line-agnostic for string content. Fixture 19 exercises emoji, accented Latin, and CJK. |
| **Wikilink targets moved** | Warn. Suggest find-and-replace. *(v0.2 — out of scope for the engine.)* |
| **_each item renamed** | Rename file, don't delete+recreate (preserves backlinks). *(v0.2 — requires iterator-aware diffing beyond the single-file merge primitive.)* |

### 17.6 Test-First Build Order

1. ✅ Write 17 spec-defined fixture files (templates, values, actual, expected) in PR #10.
2. ✅ Write test runner (`tests/unit/drift.test.ts`) that auto-discovers fixtures and dispatches by scenario kind.
3. ✅ `it.fails` all 17 before the engine exists.
4. ✅ Implement `computeMergeAction()` → skip / overwrite ownership tests pass.
5. ✅ Implement `threeWayMerge()` → auto_merge / conflict tests pass.
6. ✅ Add edge-case fixtures (empty, UTF-8, frontmatter-modified-merge) plus direct unit tests for stats invariants (`tests/unit/three-way-merge.test.ts`) and CRLF robustness (`tests/unit/differ-line-endings.test.ts`).
7. Wire into `commands/update.tsx` — *Milestone 4 / issue #12, out of scope for the merge-engine PR.*

## 20. Build Sequence

| Day | Deliverable |
|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Scaffold with `create-pastel-app`. Core: manifest.ts, schema.ts, download.ts, renderer.ts, modules.ts. runtime/index.ts exports. Unit tests. `shardmind --version` works. |
| 2 | `commands/install.tsx`: 4-value wizard + module review multiselect. State file. First E2E install of obsidian-mind. |
| 3 | Write all 16 merge fixtures. Implement drift.ts + differ.ts (TDD). node-diff3 integration. All scenarios passing. |
| 4 | `commands/update.tsx` wired to drift engine + DiffView. `commands/index.tsx` status display + verbose mode. |
| 5 | obsidian-mind v4: shard.yaml, shard-schema.yaml, .njk templates, CLAUDE.md partials, TypeScript hooks. |
| 6 | Research-wiki shard. E2E tests. README. npm publish. Announce. |

## 21. Deferred (v0.2+)

| Item | Why Deferred | Design Hint |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Dependency fetching** | Shard authors vendor deps in v0.1. Recursive download loop adds complexity. | `registry.ts` gains a `fetchDependencies()` method. |
| **Uninstall / eject** | Manual for v0.1: delete `.shardmind/` and `shard-values.yaml`. Vault keeps working. | `shardmind eject` command. ShardMind is additive, not load-bearing. |
| **Shard composition** | One shard per vault in v0.1. `state.json` has `schema_version: 1` — bump to 2 with `shards[]` when composition ships. | Affects state.json design, module conflict resolution, partial rendering. |
| **Structural variants** | Different purposes need different folder structures. For v0.1: different purposes = different shards. | `modules.structure` with purpose-driven variants. Reshape doc is the design spec. |
| **SOUL guided creation** | Ship as empty template in v0.1. | `guided_files` in schema, third install phase. |
| **`shardmind init`** | For shard authors. You are the first shard author. Build by hand. | Scaffolds `shard.yaml`, `shard-schema.yaml`, `templates/` from prompts. |

## 22. Competitive Moat

Backstage has had "propagate template updates to existing projects" as an open feature request since November 2022. Three years, no solution shipped. Cookiecutter's `cruft` tool is widely regarded as brittle. create-react-app gave up on upgrades entirely. Yeoman never attempted it.

ShardMind's update engine — hash-based drift detection, cached templates for three-way merge, declarative migrations, ownership-aware file handling — solves a problem that the biggest scaffolding platforms haven't solved. That's the moat. Not the registry. Not the TUI. The update engine.
